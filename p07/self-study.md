#### Model Answer

> **Cloud Migration Proposal for TokoMaju E-Commerce**
>
> This proposal recommends that TokoMaju, an Indonesian e-commerce startup, migrate its infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS). This migration will provide better scalability and more cost-effective operations than the current shared hosting solution.
>
> Currently, TokoMaju relies on a shared hosting service that cannot handle traffic spikes during flash sales. The servers are slower than customers expect, leading to abandoned shopping carts. The company needs a more reliable infrastructure that can grow with the business.
>
> We recommend AWS because it offers the widest range of services for e-commerce businesses. Compared to Azure, AWS provides more flexible pay-as-you-go pricing, which is better for a startup with variable traffic. The auto-scaling feature will automatically handle traffic increases during sales events. AWS also has data centers in Singapore, which means lower latency than servers located in the United States.
>
> This solution will deliver the best results for TokoMaju. The company will achieve higher uptime than the current 95%, with AWS's SLA guaranteeing 99.9% availability. Page load times will be significantly faster than before, improving customer satisfaction. Most importantly, TokoMaju will have the most scalable infrastructure possible, allowing the business to grow without worrying about server capacity.
>
> *Word count: 218 words*

**Note:** The model answer is shorter than required. Your proposal should be 250-300 words with more specific details.
