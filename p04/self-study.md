>
> The project **started** with a requirements phase where user needs **were gathered** through interviews with store managers. The system architecture **was designed** using a microservices approach to ensure scalability. During implementation, the team **worked** in two-week sprints. While we **were developing** the barcode scanning feature, we **encountered** several compatibility issues with older devices.
>
> All features **were tested** thoroughly before release. Unit tests **were written** for every function, and integration testing **was conducted** by the QA team. A critical bug **was discovered** in the synchronization module — data **was being duplicated** under certain network conditions. The bug **was fixed** within 48 hours.
>
> The application **was deployed** in stages, first to five pilot stores, then to all 50 locations. The system now **processes** over 10,000 transactions daily and **has reduced** inventory errors by 40%.
