## B. GRAMMAR SELF-STUDY

### B1. Grammar Summary: Conditional Sentences (Type 0 & Type 1)

#### Zero Conditional (General Facts & Rules)

**Form:**
- If + present simple, present simple
- When + present simple, present simple

**Use:**
1. **Scientific facts:** "If you heat water to 100°C, it boils."
2. **General truths:** "If you don't save your work, you lose it."
3. **Technical rules:** "If the firewall detects a threat, it blocks the connection."
4. **Cause and effect:** "When latency is high, the connection slows down."

**IT Examples:**
- "If you ping a server, it sends back a response."
- "If DHCP fails, devices don't get IP addresses."
- "When packet loss occurs, data needs to be resent."

**Note:** You can use "when" instead of "if" for things that always happen.

---

#### First Conditional (Real Possibilities & Predictions)

**Form:**
- If + present simple, will + base verb
- If + present simple, modal verb + base verb (can, should, might)

**Use:**
1. **Future predictions:** "If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home."
2. **Likely situations:** "If you study hard, you will pass the exam."
3. **Troubleshooting advice:** "If you restart the router, the connection will reset."

## E. WRITING TASK (Homework)

### Assignment: Network Troubleshooting Guide

**Sub-CPMK:** LO5.1 (Network Vocabulary), LO5.2 (Conditional Sentences), LO5.3 (Technical Documentation)

#### Task Description

Write a troubleshooting guide (200-250 words) for ONE of the following common network problems:

- **Option A:** "No Internet Connection"
- **Option B:** "Slow Network Speed"
- **Option C:** "Wi-Fi Keeps Disconnecting"

Your guide should help a non-technical employee solve the problem step by step.

#### Requirements Checklist

Your guide MUST include:

| Requirement | Check |
|-------------|-------|
| A clear title identifying the problem | ☐ |
| At least 4 troubleshooting steps in logical order | ☐ |
| At least 3 Zero Conditional sentences (explaining how things work) | ☐ |
| At least 2 First Conditional sentences (giving advice/predictions) | ☐ |
| At least 6 networking vocabulary terms from class | ☐ |
| At least 2 phrasal verbs used correctly | ☐ |
| 200-250 words | ☐ |

#### Guide Structure

**Section 1: Problem Description (2-3 sentences)**
- What is the problem?
- What are the symptoms?

**Section 2: Quick Checks (2-3 steps)**
- Simple things to check first
- Use Zero Conditional to explain why

**Section 3: Troubleshooting Steps (3-4 steps)**
- Detailed troubleshooting process
- Use First Conditional for advice

**Section 4: When to Contact IT (1-2 sentences)**
- When should the user escalate?

#### Model Answer

> **Troubleshooting Guide: No Internet Connection**
>
> If your computer shows "No Internet Access," don't panic—this is a common issue with simple solutions.
>
> **Quick Checks:**
> First, check if other devices can connect. If only your computer has the problem, the issue is likely with your device. When the router light is red, it means the connection to the ISP is down.
>
> **Troubleshooting Steps:**
> 1. Check that the ethernet cable is properly plugged in at both ends. If the cable is loose, the connection will drop.
> 2. Turn off your router and wait 30 seconds. If you restart the router, it will reset the connection and often fix the problem.
> 3. Open Command Prompt and type "ping 8.8.8.8". If you don't get a response, the problem is with your network connection.
> 4. Try releasing and renewing your IP address. If DHCP assigns a new IP address, your connection might be restored.
>
> **When to Contact IT:**
> If the problem persists after these steps, contact the IT support team. We will investigate the issue further.

*Word count: 183 words*

**Note:** The model is slightly shorter than required. Add more detail to reach 200-250 words.
