## B. GRAMMAR SELF-STUDY

### B1. Grammar Summary: Advanced Passive Voice & Conditionals Type 2 & 3

#### Advanced Passive Voice

**Purpose:** Focus on the process or result, not who does the action. Common in technical and academic writing.

**Form:** Subject + be (conjugated) + past participle

| Tense/Type | Structure | AI Example |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Present Simple Passive** | is/are + past participle | Data is collected from sensors. |
| **Present Continuous Passive** | is/are being + past participle | The algorithm is being tested right now. |
| **Present Perfect Passive** | has/have been + past participle | The model has been trained for three weeks. |
| **Modal Passive** | can/could/should/must + be + past participle | AI can be used to detect fraud. |
| **Passive Reporting** | It is + past participle + that... | It is believed that AI will transform healthcare. |

**When to Use Passive Voice:**
1. When the doer is unknown or unimportant: "The data was collected."
2. When focusing on the process: "Neural networks are trained on millions of images."
3. In formal/technical writing: "The algorithm is optimized for speed."
4. When the doer is obvious: "The system has been updated."

**IT Examples:**
- "Predictions are made based on historical patterns."
- "The model is being validated on real-world data."
- "Errors have been detected in the training dataset."
- "AI systems must be regulated to prevent misuse."

---

#### Conditional Type 2 (Hypothetical Present/Future)

**Form:** If + past simple, would/could/might + base verb

**Use:** Imaginary or unlikely situations in present/future

**Special Note:** Use "were" (not "was") for all subjects with "be"
- ✅ Correct: "If AI **were** unregulated..."
- ❌ Incorrect: "If AI **was** unregulated..."

**AI Examples:**
- "If we **had** more training data, the model **would be** more accurate."
- "If autonomous cars **replaced** human drivers, accidents **would decrease**."
- "What **would happen** if AI **were** completely unregulated?"

---

#### Conditional Type 3 (Hypothetical Past)

**Form:** If + past perfect, would/could/might + have + past participle

**Use:** Imaginary situations in the past (what didn't happen)

**AI Examples:**
- "If we **had used** a larger dataset, the accuracy **would have been** higher."
- "The project **would have succeeded** if we **had chosen** a different algorithm."
- "If they **hadn't implemented** AI, customer satisfaction **wouldn't have improved**."

**Common Errors to Avoid:**
- ❌ "If we would have..." → ✅ "If we had..."
- ❌ "If they had chose..." → ✅ "If they had chosen..."

#### Model Answer

> Facial recognition technology is being used increasingly in airport security systems around the world. This AI application is based on computer vision and deep learning algorithms. In this system, traveler faces are scanned and compared against databases of known individuals.
>
> The system works through a multi-stage process. First, images are captured by high-resolution cameras. Then, facial features are extracted and processed by a neural network that has been trained on millions of face images. Predictions are made by comparing the extracted features against stored data.
>
> The technology has improved airport security significantly. Processing times have been reduced by 40%, and accuracy rates have reached 99.7%. If more airports adopted this technology, international travel would become both faster and safer.
>
> However, challenges remain. Bias has been detected in some facial recognition systems, particularly with certain ethnic groups. If the training data had been more diverse, these accuracy gaps would have been smaller. Additionally, privacy concerns must be addressed through proper regulation.
>
> Overall, AI-powered facial recognition represents a promising security tool, but its implementation must be balanced with ethical considerations.

*Word count: ~180 words*

**Note:** The model answer is shorter than required. Your analysis should be 250-300 words with more details.
