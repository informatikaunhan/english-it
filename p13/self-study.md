## B. GRAMMAR SELF-STUDY

### B1. Grammar Summary: Noun Compounds & Relative Clauses

#### Noun Compounds

**Rules:**
- Noun + Noun = Compound noun (first noun modifies second)
- Stress usually on FIRST noun
- No possessive 's' between nouns
- Can be 2+ words

**Examples:**
- data scientist, machine learning, business intelligence
- data visualization tool, machine learning algorithm

---

#### Relative Clauses (Review & Extension)

**Defining vs Non-Defining Clauses:**

| Type | Function | Commas | Example |
|------|----------|--------|---------|
| Defining | Essential info, specifies which one | NO | The algorithm **that processes payments** runs 24/7. |
| Non-defining | Extra info, can be removed | YES | Python, **which is easy to learn**, is popular. |

**Relative Pronouns:**
- **who** — for people
- **which** — for things (defining and non-defining)
- **that** — for things (defining ONLY, never non-defining)
- **where** — for places
- **whose** — for possession
