## B. GRAMMAR SELF-STUDY

### B1. Grammar Summary: Modal Verbs for Security Communication

#### Modal Verbs for Obligation

**Form:** Subject + must/have to/need to + base verb

**Use:** Rules, requirements, and strong necessity in security contexts

| Modal | Strength | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **must** | Very strong (rule/law) | "All employees must complete security training." |
| **have to** | Strong (external requirement) | "We have to comply with data protection laws." |
| **need to** | Medium (necessity) | "You need to update your antivirus software." |

**IT Security Examples:**
- "Passwords must be at least 12 characters long."
- "Sensitive data has to be encrypted before transmission."
- "Staff need to report suspicious emails immediately."

---

#### Modal Verbs for Advice/Recommendation

**Form:** Subject + should/ought to + base verb

**Use:** Recommendations and suggestions for security best practices

| Modal | Use | Example |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **should** | General advice | "You should use a password manager." |
| **ought to** | Formal advice | "Organizations ought to conduct regular audits." |
| **had better** | Strong warning | "You had better not ignore those security alerts." |

**IT Security Examples:**
- "You should change your password every 90 days."
- "Companies ought to invest in employee training."
- "You'd better back up your data regularly."

---

#### Modal Verbs for Prohibition

**Form:** Subject + must not/cannot + base verb

**Use:** Expressing what is forbidden or not allowed

| Modal | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **must not** | Forbidden (prohibition) | "Employees must not share passwords." |
| **cannot** | Not allowed | "You cannot access the server without authorization." |

⚠️ **Important Distinction:**
- **must not** = forbidden (you are NOT allowed to do this)
- **don't have to** = not necessary (you don't need to, but you can if you want)

**Correct Usage:**
- ✅ "You must not share your password." (It's forbidden)
- ✅ "You don't have to memorize the policy number." (It's not required)
- ❌ "You don't must share your password." (WRONG!)

---

#### Future Forms for Predictions

**Use:** Making predictions about cybersecurity trends and consequences

| Form | Certainty | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **will** | Certain | "Cyber attacks will continue to increase." |
| **will probably** | Likely | "AI will probably transform threat detection." |
| **may/might** | Possible | "Quantum computing might break current encryption." |
| **going to** | Based on evidence | "This vulnerability is going to cause problems." |

> **Email Security Policy**
>
> **Purpose:** This policy establishes guidelines for secure email communication to protect company data and prevent cyber attacks.
>
> **Requirements:**
> All employees must verify the sender's email address before clicking any links or downloading attachments. Staff should be especially cautious with emails requesting urgent action or sensitive information. Employees have to report suspicious emails to the IT security team at security@company.com within 24 hours. Users ought to regularly review their spam folder settings and keep their email client updated.
>
> **Prohibitions:**
> Employees must not open attachments from unknown or untrusted sources. Staff must not forward company emails to personal email accounts. Users must not respond to emails requesting passwords or financial information — legitimate organizations will never ask for this via email.
>
> **Consequences:**
> Violations of this policy may result in disciplinary action, including written warnings, suspension of email privileges, or termination depending on the severity of the breach.
>
> Remember: Phishing attacks are one of the biggest threats to our organization. When in doubt, verify before you click.
