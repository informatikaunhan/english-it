## B. GRAMMAR SELF-STUDY

### B1. Grammar Summary: Relative Clauses & Gerunds/Infinitives

#### Relative Clauses

**What are relative clauses?**
Relative clauses add extra information about people or things. They use words like who, which, that, where.

**1. Defining Relative Clauses** (no commas — essential information)
- Tell us which person or thing we're talking about
- Use: who (people), which/that (things), where (places)
- Examples:
  - "The framework **that we use** is React." (Which framework? The one we use.)
  - "Developers **who know TypeScript** are in high demand." (Which developers? Those who know TypeScript.)

**2. Non-defining Relative Clauses** (commas — extra information)
- Add extra information about something already identified
- Use: who (people), which (things) — NOT "that"
- MUST use commas!
- Examples:
  - "React, **which is maintained by Facebook**, is very popular."
  - "Node.js, **which enables server-side JavaScript**, works well with React."

**Common Errors:**
- ✗ React, that is popular... → ✓ React, which is popular...
- ✗ Node.js which is a runtime... → ✓ Node.js, which is a runtime... (needs commas!)
- ✗ The developer which created this... → ✓ The developer who created this... (use "who" for people)

---

#### Gerunds & Infinitives

**Gerund = verb + -ing (used as a noun)**
**Infinitive = to + verb (used to express purpose or after certain verbs)**

**When to use GERUNDS (-ing):**

1. **After prepositions:**
   - "I'm interested **in learning** React."
   - "Before **starting** development, we need a plan."
   - "He's good **at debugging** complex issues."

2. **After certain verbs:** enjoy, finish, avoid, consider, practice, stop (when it means "quit")
   - "I enjoy **coding** in JavaScript."
   - "We finished **deploying** the website."

3. **As the subject:**
   - "**Testing** the website is essential."
   - "**Debugging** requires patience."

**When to use INFINITIVES (to + verb):**

1. **To express purpose (why):**
   - "I use CSS **to style** web pages."
   - "We need a framework **to build** the frontend."

2. **After certain verbs:** want, need, plan, decide, hope, learn, try (when it means "attempt")
   - "I want **to learn** full-stack development."
   - "We plan **to deploy** next week."

3. **After adjectives:**
   - "It's important **to test** thoroughly."
   - "The site is easy **to navigate**."

**Verbs that change meaning:**
- **stop + gerund:** "I stopped **coding**." (I quit the activity)
- **stop + infinitive:** "I stopped **to code**." (I paused to do it)
- **try + gerund:** "Try **refreshing** the page." (experiment with this)
- **try + infinitive:** "I'll try **to fix** it." (make an effort)

**Common Errors:**
- ✗ I want learning → ✓ I want **to learn**
- ✗ I'm good at code → ✓ I'm good at **coding**
- ✗ For improve → ✓ **To improve**

#### Model Answer

> **How to Set Up a React Development Environment**
>
> Setting up a React development environment is essential for building modern web applications. This guide explains the process of installing the necessary tools and creating your first React project.
>
> Before starting development, you need to install Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime. Installing Node.js automatically includes npm, which manages packages. You can download it from the official website. After completing the installation, verify it by running `node --version` in your terminal to check the version.
>
> After installing Node.js, you're ready to create your React project. The easiest method is using Create React App, which is a tool that sets up everything automatically. Run `npx create-react-app my-app` to generate a new project. This command, which may take a few minutes, creates all the files you need. The project structure includes folders for components, styles, and tests. Understanding this structure helps you organize your code effectively.
>
> To start developing, navigate to your project folder and run `npm start`. This command starts a development server, which automatically opens your browser. You can now begin building components and see changes in real-time.
>
> Setting up a React environment is straightforward once you understand these steps. Practice creating new projects to become familiar with the workflow.

*Word count: ~210 words*

**Note:** The model answer is shorter than required. Your documentation should be 250-300 words with more details.
