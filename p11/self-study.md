#### Model Answer

> **FitBuddy: Your AI-Powered Fitness Companion**
>
> Many Indonesian university students struggle to maintain a consistent exercise routine due to busy schedules and limited gym access. FitBuddy is going to solve this by providing personalized, equipment-free workout plans that adapt to each user's schedule and fitness level.
>
> We're going to target university students aged 18-25 who want to stay fit but have limited time and resources. The app will be more accessible than existing fitness apps because all workouts require no equipment.
>
> Key features include: (1) an AI-powered workout generator that creates personalized routines, (2) push notifications with smart scheduling based on class timetables, (3) a social feature where users can challenge friends, (4) progress tracking with data visualization, and (5) integration with health APIs.
>
> We're developing the app using React Native because it is more cost-effective than native development and allows us to deploy on both iOS and Android simultaneously. This is the fastest approach for an MVP launch.
>
> We're launching the beta version next semester with 200 student testers. By Q3, we will have a full commercial release. The health and fitness app market is the fastest-growing category in Southeast Asia, and FitBuddy will be the most student-focused app available.
