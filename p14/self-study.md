## B. GRAMMAR SELF-STUDY

### B1. Grammar Summary: Modal Verbs for Possibility & Certainty; Time Expressions

#### Modal Verbs Scale (Least to Most Certain)

```
POSSIBILITY (30-50%)          EXPECTATION (70-80%)          CERTAINTY (90-100%)
might / may / could     →     should / will probably    →    will / must

"We might need help."         "It should work fine."        "We will finish on time."
```

---

#### 1. Weak Possibility: might / may / could (30-50% certain)

**Use when:** You think something is possible but not very likely.

**Examples:**
- We **might** encounter bugs during testing.
- There **may** be delays if the API changes.
- This **could** cause performance issues.

**Key Difference:**
- **might/may** = general possibility
- **could** = often used for potential problems or suggestions

---

#### 2. Strong Expectation: should / will probably (70-80% certain)

**Use when:** You expect something to happen based on evidence or experience.

**Examples:**
- The feature **should** be ready by Friday.
- Testing **will probably** take three days.
- We **should** complete 30 story points.

**Note:** "should" can also mean obligation ("You should test your code"), but in project contexts, it usually expresses expectation.

---

#### 3. Certainty: will / must (90-100% certain)

**will** = definite future:
- We **will** deliver on time.
- The client **will** approve the design.

**must** = logical deduction or requirement:
- The bug **must** be in the database code.
- We **must** complete testing before deployment.

---

#### 4. Impossibility: can't / couldn't

**Use when:** Something is not possible.

**Examples:**
- We **can't** release without security testing.
- That **can't** be the correct error message.

---

#### Time Expressions

**Deadlines (by + time):**
- **by Friday** = on or before Friday
- **by the end of the month** = on or before the last day
- **within two days** = in two days or less

**Duration (for + period):**
- **for three weeks** = duration of three weeks
- **during the sprint** = at some time in the sprint period

**Frequency:**
- **daily stand-ups** = every day
- **weekly reviews** = every week
- **every two weeks** = biweekly

**Sequence:**
- **before deployment** = first testing, then deployment
- **after testing** = first testing, then something else
- **following the review** = after the review

---

### B3. Additional Grammar Practice

**Exercise 1: Choose the Correct Modal**

1. We ( might / must / will ) need to hire another developer if the project scope increases. *(possibility)*
2. The deployment ( should / might / can't ) happen tomorrow as planned. *(expectation)*
3. You ( must / should / might ) complete code review before merging. *(requirement)*
4. There ( could / will / must ) be integration issues with the new API. *(potential problem)*
5. We ( can't / might not / shouldn't ) launch without client approval. *(impossibility)*

**Exercise 2: Rewrite Using Modals**

Change these sentences using the modal verb in parentheses:

1. It's possible that the sprint will be delayed. (might)
   → _________________________________________________________________
2. I expect the testing to finish by Wednesday. (should)
   → _________________________________________________________________
3. It's required to backup the database before migration. (must)
   → _________________________________________________________________
4. I'm certain we'll meet the deadline. (will)
   → _________________________________________________________________

#### Model Answer

> **PROJECT STATUS REPORT**
>
> Project: HealthTracker Mobile App
> Sprint: Sprint 8 (Oct 15-29, 2024)
> Prepared by: [Your Name], Lead Developer
>
> **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
> Sprint 8 has been largely successful, with 28 out of 30 story points completed. The user authentication feature is now live, and we're on track for our beta launch in six weeks.
>
> **ACHIEVEMENTS THIS SPRINT**
> - Completed user authentication with biometric login
> - Integrated fitness tracker API (Apple Health, Google Fit)
> - Delivered notification system
> - Achieved 85% code test coverage
>
> **CHALLENGES & ISSUES**
> The Apple Health integration took three extra days due to API documentation issues. This could affect our timeline if similar problems occur with other integrations. Battery optimization on older Android devices might require additional sprint time.
>
> **CURRENT STATUS**
> We're currently working on data synchronization and offline mode functionality. The team should complete these features by the end of this week.
>
> **NEXT STEPS & TIMELINE**
> By next Friday, we will begin beta testing with 100 users. Within two weeks, we must address all critical bugs identified during testing. The team will probably need to extend Sprint 9 by three days to ensure quality.
>
> **RISK ASSESSMENT**
> There may be delays if Apple rejects our app during review. Privacy concerns could require significant code changes. We might need to hire an additional developer if the scope increases further.

*Word count: ~215 words*

**Note:** The model answer is shorter than required. Your report should be 250-300 words with more details.
